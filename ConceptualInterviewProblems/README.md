# Conceptual Interview Problems in Golang
This list was taken from a post [found on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/20ahfq/heres_a_pretty_big_list_of_programming_interview/?st=j8dc7k2e&sh=11599122)

Each section (General/Strings/Trees...) is under its own subdirectory.


### General
 - DONE - Find the most frequent integer in an array
 - DONE - Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)
 - DONE - Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
 - DONE - Write fibonacci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
 - DONE - Find the only element in an array that only occurs once.
 - DONE - Find the common elements of 2 int arrays
 - DONE - Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
 - DONE - Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
 - DONE - Use dynamic programming to find the first X prime numbers
 - DONE - Write a function that prints out the binary form of an int
 - DONE - Implement parseInt
 - DONE - Implement squareroot function
 - DONE - Implement an exponent function (bonus: now try in log(n) time)
 - DONE - Write a multiply function that multiples 2 integers without using *
 - DONE - HARD: Given a function rand5() that returns a random int between 0 and 5, implement rand7()
 - DONE - HARD: Given a 2D array of 1s and 0s, count the number of "islands of 1s" (e.g. groups of connecting 1s)
